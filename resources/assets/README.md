# SDK-UI-Scenarios

## How to use this repository

This repository holds all UI test scenarios and their relative JSON files.

The master branch will be the reference branch used to run the UI tests on both platforms.

Both android and iOS have a dedicated development branch they can use to develop new tests or temporarily run different ones than the one in master.
